# Todo

Since I'm getting back into React, I decided to make a simple todo app. It's not going to be any different from the 300+ todo apps out already, but it's a start.

## Getting Started

I used `create react app` to set things up (Didn't want to worry about setting up babel and webpack). Follow the following steps to get up and running.

1. Enter `git clone https://github.com/furious-pineapple/Basic-React-App.git` to your terminal.
2. Go to the repo `cd Basic-React-App/`.
3. Start up `npm run start`.
4. Have fun breaking things :)
